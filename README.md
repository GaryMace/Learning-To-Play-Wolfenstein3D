# Learning To Play Wolfenstein3D

An ongoing implementation of the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm designed by Kenneth O.Stanley & Risto Miikulainen that progressively learns to play Wolfenstein3D as part of my final year computer science project. The algorithm is implemented in C++ in order to accompany to Wolf4SDL source port which is also written in C++

## Compiling

You will need a legitate copy of Wolfenstein 3-D in order to run this source code. This was compiled and run with Dev-C++ 5.0 Beta 9.2 (4.9.9.2).
