# Learning To Play Wolfenstein3D

An ongoing implementation of the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm designed by Kenneth O.Stanley & Risto Miikulainen that progressively learns to play Wolfenstein3D as part of my final year computer science project. The algorithm is implemented in C++ in order to accompany to Wolf4SDL source port which is also written in C++

## Reasons why using this old version of C++ is hell
- Array instantiation isn't allowed in header files
- for (Element e : elements) { ....} isn't allowed...you gotta use for (int i = 0; i < elements.size(); i++) {..}
- There's no std::to_string(double) method, you gotta use str = static_cast<std::ostringstream*>(&(std::ostringstream() << mydouble))->str();


## Things that took way to long to find!
- tilemap[MAPSIZE][MAPSIZE] stores a byte map representation of all the walls on a level. 0 for walkable free space for a player and anything else is a byte from the (word) mapsegs[MAPPLANES] list. This will serve as an input to doop :D. It took an hour and a half of searching to find the setter for this thing... Who names a wall data array TILEMAP???????? WHAT'S WRONG WITH WALLMAP[][]???
- More fantastic naming, statobjlist[MAXSTATS] is an array storing static object struct references. These include things like ammo, guns, health, treasure etc..
- objlist[MAXACTORS] is an array of all actors (enemies, also the player) structs on the current map.
